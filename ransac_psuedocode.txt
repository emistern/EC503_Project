s = smallest number of points to define model
N = number of iterations 
d = distance to line threshold 
T = number of inliers
While iterations < N
	draw s points from data set
	fit model to s points
	T = 0
	for all other points in data set not in s
		if point < d distance to model
			T = T + 1
	if T of this model > T of previous model
		best model = this model
